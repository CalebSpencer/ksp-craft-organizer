TODO:
 - Correct bug with tags not being saved in this scenario: open craft -> change name -> save -> go to different building using "go to" plugin
 - Remember selected filter separately for VABinVAB/SPHinVAB/VABinSPH/SPHinSPH
 - Add above the craft list a list of non-default selected tags with possibility to clear them, like:
 	Bodies: [Eve x] [Duna x] BuildingStage: [Final x] [Clear All] [>>]
 - Cache cost/part count/etc in separate file so loading is much faster
 - Add button "+" inside craft that will add tag in a given category
 - Add button "+" inside craft that will add tag in any category
 - Add button "x" next to each tag in craft that will remove it
 - Add dropdown box for each tag that will allow it to be changed to different one in the same category
 
Cancelled or far future:
 - Add toolbar next to category in filters: [All | Any | Single]
 - Show "Cancel & discard changes" only if some tags were actually modified
 - Allow to modify window width
 - Limit number of writes in CurrentCraftSettings window
 - Base it on plugin settings: when editor is locked the "close" should be locked as well
 
 
Done:
 - The tags selected in a single group should display crafts with any of the selected tags
 - Add tooltip that will show big thumbnail, name and description
 - Add double-click to load
 - Correct bug: select "all" in "-Archived?", click cancel, open window. The filter returns to default
 - Correct the way how min width is computed if there is gui scaling
 - Correct bug: open ships with tags -> change name (no save !) -> launch -> revert -> save. Bug: tags are not saved
 - Add icons to toolbar
 - Add darker background when windows are displayed
 - Remove "Edit" skin from manage window
 - Remember skin between editor opens
 - Check if parts used in craft are available due to science
 - Add performance logs while loading crafts
 - Hide tags filtering if no craft has assigned tag & display only used tags
 - Focus text search window when window is opened
 - Solve problem with strange height of some scroll windows
 - Lock editor when managing tags
 - Add "new tag" field to the window with tags for current craft
 - Add Delete button
 - Make all windows inherit from common class
 - Show warning when craft is going to be loaded and current craft is unsaved
 - Allow to discard changes made in tags
 - Refactor script.cs, introduce Debug & Release versions
 - change everything except MonBehavior to camelCase
 - Draw tags as categories in craft list
 - Introduce plugin settings: it will have "Debug" option + default available tags
 - Save tags for stock crafts inside save folder instead of shared folder
 - When editor is locked the "close" should be locked as well
 - add "Status\Archived" to default tags, change the prefix "Building Stage\" to "Status\"
 - In "Filter" window show tags in categories. In each category add special filtering option <with no tag from this category>
 - make changes to make it possible to have "archived" tag that will be quite natural to use
 - Load craft lazily - first load metadata if it exists (it should contain the craft name as well), then filter the crafts
 	and lastly load full craft's data only if it is on the list
 - make the window wider on wider monitors
 - Correct craft renaming (make sure tags are properly written)
 - If craft name in settings file is incorrect then correct it automatically
 - Correct bug that settings are marked as dirty in each frame
 - Solve problem with overlap labels
 - Solve problem with accident part clicks when window is hidden
 - Allow to Scale UI
 - Correct display of group names on craft list
 - when existing ship is saved with changed name the tags should be saved as well
 - automatically deselect <none> when any other tag is selected + the other way round
 - Show "The filter is applied [clear]" instead of current message & behaviour
